# Understanding-Naive-Bayes-with-Scikit-learn
This repository provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing Naive Bayes algorithms using Scikit-learn. The examples cover three main types of Naive Bayes classifiers—GaussianNB, MultinomialNB, and BernoulliNB—demonstrating their application, performance, and hyperparameter tuning.
